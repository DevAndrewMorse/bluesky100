## Changes Made
- **CSS**: The original inline styles from `index.html` have been moved to a dedicated CSS file located at `css/styles.css`.
- **JavaScript**: The JavaScript logic that handles the word display has been separated into its own file located at `js/scripts.js`.

## Files Overview
- `index.html`: The main HTML file where the structure and layout are defined.
- `css/styles.css`: Contains the styles for the application.
- `js/scripts.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for fetching and displaying the top 100 words from the BlueSky firehose every 5 seconds.
